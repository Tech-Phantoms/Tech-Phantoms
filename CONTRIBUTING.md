## 🚫 Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the website, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

**DO NOT OPEN ISSUES UNNECESSARILY ESPECIALLY BLANK ISSUES**

For example, start by explaining how you started Tech-Phantoms, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or which command?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

### 🟩 Code Contribution

We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
If you have never contributed before, you can start by looking through these [`good-first`](https://github.com/Tech-Phantoms/Tech-Phantoms/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) issues:


Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

<br/>

## 📣 Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include proper description of the changes you made to help maintainers understand your changes better.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best discuss it first in our [Discord Community](https://discord.apihacks.co/). This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the following workflow:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally and make changes in any code editor
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
7. All PRs should be made to the canary branch only.

<br/>

## 📝 Guidelines

- Issues will be assigned on a first come, first serve basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR.
